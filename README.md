Data and code associated with manuscript by Dennis et al, 2025.

## Update: September 2025

* located bug in calculation of holding for large properties, code adjusted in holds_match.py
* added scripts for creating the summary csvs
* updated summary csvs to reflect holding id change -- in all regions the number of holdings is smaller (expected based on bug, conclusions remain)
* added requirements.txt (was missing from original repository)
